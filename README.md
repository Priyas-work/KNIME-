# KNIME- Ranolazine alternatives for Myocardial Infarction
**Project overview**
This repository contains the workflow to identify a drug alternative for myocardial infarction. This occurs due to low level of blood supply to the heart. This workflow is an attempt to find a drug, alternative to Ranolazine using KNIME.
**Tools and Method**
Data collection through PubChem 
Data integration through Knime
**Steps**
Drug Selection 
     1.Through PubChem library
Data Integration
     Comparision of 2D and 3D similarity 
     Vizualization of the Results
**Results**
2D similarity:The highest value being 0.75 exhibited in row 35
3D similarity:The RMSD results highlight that rows 46 and 86 align most closely to Ranolazine in 3D space
**Conclusion**
The workflow findings provide insights for research for Ranolazine alternatives for myocardial infarction.The discovered analogs may be useful looking for new drugs and improving existing ones.
